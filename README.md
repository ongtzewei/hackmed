The team came in as 2nd runner-up for MITâ€™s Hacking Medicine Hackathon in 2015 with a website that simplifies meal planning by overwhelmed caregivers for malnourished elderly to meet their nutritional adequacy.
This repository holds the codes written for the prototype (code for it doesn't really work) developed for Hackathon@SG 2015.

Caregivers can simply drag and drop the images of food items into a timeline to visually get a sense of how much nutritional adequacy is met for the elderly.
